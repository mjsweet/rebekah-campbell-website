In 2012, I hadn't been on a date in ten years. I was 34, lonely, and terrified of the future. I decided to hit the online dating sites on a mission to date one man every week for a year and find a husband.

What followed was a year of ups, downs, and 138 dates that changed my life forever.

## 1. Be Honest About What You Want

One of the biggest mistakes I made early on was not being clear about what I was looking for. I was so worried about seeming "too intense" that I downplayed my desire for a serious relationship.

The truth is, being upfront about wanting a committed partnership actually helps filter out people who aren't on the same page. It saves everyone time.

## 2. Your Profile Photo Matters (But Not How You Think)

Yes, you need good photos. But "good" doesn't mean heavily filtered or professionally staged. The photos that worked best for me were ones where I looked genuinely happy and relaxed.

People can spot authenticity. A candid photo of you laughing with friends often works better than a perfect posed shot.

## 3. Treat the Process Like a Learning Experience

Every date, even the terrible ones, taught me something. I learned about my own patterns, my blind spots, and what I actually valued in a partner (as opposed to what I thought I should value).

Keep a journal. Reflect on each date. Ask yourself what worked and what didn't.

## 4. Don't Give Up After a Bad Stretch

There were times when I went on five or six disappointing dates in a row. It would have been easy to conclude that online dating didn't work and give up.

But finding the right person is partly a numbers game. You have to meet enough people to find someone compatible. Persistence matters.

## 5. Know When to Take a Break

That said, dating burnout is real. If you're feeling cynical, exhausted, or resentful, it's okay to step back for a few weeks. You'll come back with fresh energy.

The goal isn't to race to the finish line. It's to find someone genuinely right for you, and that takes time.
