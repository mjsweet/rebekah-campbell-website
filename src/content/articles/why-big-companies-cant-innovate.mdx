After building companies from scratch and later working with large corporations, I've seen a pattern that explains why big companies struggle to innovate.

It's not that they lack smart people. It's not that they lack resources. The problem is structural.

## The Incentive Problem

In a startup, everyone's incentives are aligned around survival and growth. If the company doesn't innovate, it dies. There's no safety net.

In a large company, the incentives are different. Middle managers are rewarded for not rocking the boat. Taking a big risk that fails could end your career. Taking no risk and maintaining the status quo is safe.

## The Speed Problem

Startups can make decisions in a day. Large companies can take months to approve even minor initiatives.

By the time a big company has gone through all the approval layers, a startup has already tested, iterated, and shipped.

## The Customer Distance Problem

In a startup, founders are often talking to customers daily. They feel the pain points viscerally.

In large companies, customer feedback is filtered through multiple layers before reaching decision-makers. The urgency gets lost.

## What Can Be Done?

Some companies have found ways to maintain innovation at scale:

1. **Create separate innovation units** with their own budgets and decision-making authority
2. **Reward intelligent risk-taking**, even when it fails
3. **Bring executives closer to customers** through regular direct interactions
4. **Acquire startups** and let them operate semi-independently

But these are workarounds. The fundamental structure of large organisations works against innovation.

## The Opportunity for Founders

This is actually good news if you're a founder. Large companies will always struggle to compete with nimble startups in rapidly changing markets.

Your speed and closeness to customers are advantages they can't easily replicate.
