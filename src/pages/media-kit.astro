                <p>
                  Rebekah Campbell is a serial entrepreneur, author, columnist, and coach based in Sydney, Australia. Her career spans the music industry, technology startups, and personal development coaching.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At 24, Rebekah founded Scorpio Music, which grew into one of Australia's largest independent music labels. The label launched artists including Evermore, Matt Corby, Lisa Mitchell, and Van She, selling over 2 million records with offices in Sydney, New York, and London.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Transitioning to technology, Rebekah co-founded Hey You, which became Australia's largest mobile payments platform for cafes and restaurants. The company grew to serve 500,000+ customers with 100,000+ weekly transactions and is now majority owned by Westpac Bank's Reinventure fund. Across her ventures, she has raised over $17 million in venture capital.

                <p>
                  In 2012, after a decade without dating following personal tragedy, Rebekah committed to going on one date per week for a year. She ended up going on 138 dates before meeting her husband Rod. That journey became her memoir, 138 Dates: The True Story of One Woman's Search for Everything, published by Allen and Unwin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rebekah writes fortnightly for The New York Times and monthly for AFR BOSS Magazine. She was named a Woman of Influence in 2015 and an APEC Young Woman Innovator. She has spoken at TEDx Sydney, Business Chicks, Google, Atlassian, and major corporations including the big four banks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, Rebekah runs coaching programs helping people find love, launch businesses, and raise capital. She lives in Sydney with her husband Rod and their two children, Bobby and Eve.
