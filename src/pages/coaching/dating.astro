          You've built a career. You've got your life together. But when it comes to relationships, something isn't clicking. I've been exactly where you are. At 34, I hadn't dated in a decade. So I committed to one date a week for a year. I went on 138 dates. And I found my husband.

        The Real Reason You Haven't Found Your Person Yet
      </h2>
      <div class="prose mx-auto">
        <p>
          It's not because you're too picky. It's not because all the good ones are taken. It's not because you're "too much" or "not enough."
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth is that modern dating is genuinely hard. The apps have changed everything. The rules your parents followed don't apply anymore. And most dating advice is written by people who've never actually had to navigate today's landscape.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Common challenges I hear:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>"I keep attracting emotionally unavailable partners"</li>
          <li>"I don't know how to be myself on dates"</li>
          <li>"I'm exhausted by the endless cycle of matching and ghosting"</li>
          <li>"I've been hurt before and I'm scared to be vulnerable again"</li>
          <li>"I have high standards and I'm not willing to settle, but I'm starting to wonder if I'm being unrealistic"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If any of this sounds familiar, you're in the right place.</p>

          <p class="text-neutral-900/70">Absolutely. The principles of authentic connection don't change with age. Many of our participants are in their 40s and 50s, and they find the content just as relevant.</p>

          <p class="text-neutral-900/70">That's completely fine. While we discuss online dating as one tool, the program covers all approaches to meeting potential partners. Many women meet their person through other channels.</p>
