          Most advice comes from people who've read about success. Mine comes from living it.

        <div class="prose mx-auto">
          <p>
            I've stood on stage at sold-out concerts for artists I discovered. I've sat across the table from venture capitalists who wrote million-dollar cheques. I've swiped through dating apps at 2am wondering if love was even possible at 34. And I've navigated the messy, uncertain path from each of those moments to something better.
          </p>

          <h3>What makes my approach different:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Lived experience, not theory.</strong> I've raised $17M+ across my ventures, sold over 2 million records, and yes, went on 138 actual dates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Battle-tested frameworks.</strong> Everything I teach comes from what worked (and what spectacularly failed) in my own journey.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Honest vulnerability.</strong> I share the mistakes, the setbacks, and the unglamorous middle bits that most people hide.
